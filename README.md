# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.1.x`+ and NPM `2.14.x`+

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```
